# Emacs docker images

Docker images for software development, containing Emacs and one or more of the following languages:

- Python

## Why?

- To have a piece of code that lists everything I use to work on programs.

- To have a work environment that I can use on any machine running docker.

- To avoid as much as possible installing packages I will forget about on my machines.
